{"name":"Atomistica","tagline":"Atomistica is a library of interatomic potentials that is compatible with ASE and LAMMPS","body":"Atomistica\r\n==========\r\n\r\nAtomistica is a library of interatomic potentials written in Fortran. It is\r\ndesigned to be used with different computational engines. Currently supported\r\nare ASE and LAMMPS (see below). A list of supported interatomic potentials can\r\nbe found [here](https://github.com/Atomistica/atomistica/blob/master/POTENTIALS.md).\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAtomistica can be used in two distinct manners. It is recommended to compile the\r\nASE interface first and run the tests in the \"tests\" subdirectory. (See ASE\r\nintructions below.)\r\n\r\nCurrently supported engines are...\r\n\r\n1.  ...the Atomistic Simulation Environment   \r\n    (ASE - see https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/)\r\n    * Build instructions are in README.PYTHON\r\n    * Examples are in examples/ASE\r\n    * Tests are in tests\r\n\r\n2.  ...the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator   \r\n    (LAMMPS - see https://lammps.sandia.gov/)\r\n    * Build instructions are in README.LAMMPS\r\n    * Examples are in examples/LAMMPS\r\n\r\nYou need the following packages:\r\n\r\n* Python 2.4.0 or greater (even if you do not compile the Python interface)\r\n\r\n\r\nContact\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThis software is mainly developed at [Fraunhofer IWM](http://www.en.iwm.fraunhofer.de/business-units/tribology/multiscale-modeling-and-tribosimulation/) and [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](http://www.iam.kit.edu/zbs/english/).
