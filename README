Atomistica is a library of interatomic potentials. It currently supports the
potentials described in the following publication:

  Lars Pastewka, Andreas Klemenz, Peter Gumbsch, Michael Moseler
  Screened empirical bond-order potential for Si-C
  Phys. Rev. B 87, 205410 (2013) - http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.87.205410
  arXiv:1301.2142 - http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2142

Atomistica can be used in two distinct manners:

1. From Python using the Atomistic Simulation Environment
   (ASE - see https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/)
   * Build instructions are in README.PYTHON
   * Examples are in examples/ASE

2. From within LAMMPS as a separate pair style
   (LAMMPS - see https://lammps.sandia.gov/)
   * Build instructions are in README.LAMMPS
   * Examples are in examples/LAMMPS

You need the following packages:

* Python 2.4.0 or greater (even if you do not compile the Python interface)
  (Some parts of the Python interface could rely on features from Python 2.6.0)
