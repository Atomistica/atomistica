# This is the most minimal-idiotic way of discovering the version that I
# could come up with. It deals with the following issues:
# * If we are installed, we can get the version from package metadata,
#   either via importlib.metadata or from pkg_resources. This also holds for
#   wheels that contain the metadata. We are good! Yay!
# * If we are not installed, there are two options:
#   - We are working within the source git repository. Then
#        git describe --tags --always
#     yields a reasonable version descriptor, but that is unfortunately not
#     PEP 440 compliant (see https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/). We need to
#     mangle the version string to yield something compatible.
# - If we are not in a source directory, check if muGrid's version.cc has
#   been created and extract version from that file.
# - If we install from a source tarball, all version information may be lost.
#   Fortunately, Meson uses git archive to create the source tarball, which
#   replaces certain tags with commit information. Unfortunately, what this
#   yields is different from `git describe` - in particular, it only yields the
#   tag (which contains the version information) if we are *exactly* on the
#   tag commit. (`git describe` tells us the distance from the latest tag.) We
#   need to extract the version information from the string provided, but if
#   we are not on the tag we can only return a bogus version (here 0.0.0.0).
#   It works for releases, but not for a tarball generated from a random
#   commit. I am not happy and open for suggestions.
